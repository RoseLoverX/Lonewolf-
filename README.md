# Saviour SOS ðŸ†˜

## Description

Saviour SOS is a project designed to provide first aid solutions for health emergencies using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model. The system is integrated with Telegram and allows users to interact with the chatbot through a Telegram bot.

The project has two main components:

- A Golang backend powered by ChatGPT that receives input from an Arduino heart monitor via serial port and sends Telegram notifications to alert users of potential health emergencies.
- A frontend UI website that provides first aid information for different symptoms using the ChatGPT model.

## System Components

### Golang Backend

The Golang backend is responsible for receiving input from an Arduino heart monitor connected to the COM3 port. The heart monitor records heartbeats every 4 seconds and sends them to the Golang backend via serial port.

The backend uses ChatGPT, an open-source implementation of the GPT-3.5 language model, to provide first aid solutions for different health emergencies. The backend is also integrated with Telegram and sends notifications to alert users of potential health emergencies.

### Frontend UI Website

The frontend UI website provides first aid information for different symptoms. Users can manually input their symptoms and receive first aid solutions generated by the ChatGPT model.

## Installation

To install the system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running go mod download.
3. Copy the config.example.json file to config.json and update it with your Telegram bot token and OpenAI API key.
4. Run the program with go run main.go.

## Usage

To use the system, follow these steps:

1. Start the Golang backend by running go run main.go.
2. Open the frontend UI website by visiting http://localhost:8080/.
3. To receive notifications on Telegram, add the Telegram bot to a group or send it direct messages.

## OpenAI GPT-3.5 Language Model via ChatGPT

The project uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model via ChatGPT to generate first aid solutions for health emergencies. ChatGPT is accessed by bypassing the Cloudflare bot protection using an initial authentication with an email and password, followed by an access token.

The GPT-3.5 language model is trained on a diverse set of internet text and is capable of generating near-accurate predictions. It is used in the project to provide first aid solutions for the symptoms reported by the user.

The backend sends the symptoms to ChatGPT as input, and ChatGPT generates a response that includes a list of first aid actions in order. The response is then sent as a notification to the user's Telegram account via the Telegram bot.

The use of ChatGPT enables the project to provide timely and relevant first aid solutions in case of health emergencies, without the need for manual intervention by medical professionals.

## Arduino Heartbeat Monitor

An Arduino Uno board is used to monitor the user's heartbeat. The board is connected to a heartbeat sensor and records the user's heart rate every 4 seconds. The data is sent to the Go backend via a serial port. 

The Arduino board is programmed to use the serial.Write() function to send data to the backend every 4 seconds. The backend listens to the serial port and parses the data received from the Arduino.

The heartbeat data is used by the backend to generate first aid solutions using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 language model. The solutions are then sent as notifications to the user's Telegram account via the Telegram bot.

The use of the Arduino heartbeat monitor adds an extra layer of functionality to the project by enabling real-time monitoring of the user's health. This allows the project to provide timely and relevant first aid solutions in case of health emergencies.

## Adruino Circuite

Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It has 14 digital input/output pins, 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz quartz crystal, a USB connection, a power jack, and an ICSP header.

To monitor heartbeats using Arduino Uno, you can connect a heart rate sensor module to the board. The heart rate sensor module usually consists of a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and a green LED. The PPG sensor detects changes in blood volume, which allows it to detect the heart rate.

To connect the heart rate sensor module to the Arduino Uno board, you can use the following connections:

- VCC -> 5V
- GND -> GND
- S -> A0

Once the heart rate sensor module is connected, you can write a program using the Arduino IDE to read the heart rate and send it via serial communication to a computer. The program can be as simple as the following:

```c
const int SENSOR_PIN = A0;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  int heartRate = analogRead(SENSOR_PIN);
  Serial.println(heartRate);
  delay(4000);
}
```

This program reads the heart rate from the sensor every 4 seconds and sends it to the computer via serial communication at a baud rate of 9600. You can use a serial terminal program such as Arduino's Serial Monitor or a third-party program such as PuTTY to read the heart rate values sent by the Arduino Uno board.
